### 4.3 Calculation Logic

#### Step 1: Fuel Required

```
Fuel Needed = Distance / Mileage
```

#### Step 2: Total Fuel Cost

```
Total Cost = Fuel Needed × Fuel Price
```

#### Step 3: Split Count

```
If Include Owner = true:
    Split Count = People
Else:
    Split Count = People - 1
```

#### Step 4: Cost Per Person

```
Each Pays = Total Cost / Split Count
```

#### Step 5: Apply Rounding

* Exact → no change
* ₹1 → round(amount/1)*1
* ₹5 → round(amount/5)*5
* ₹10 → round(amount/10)*10
